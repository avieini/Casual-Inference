# Casual-Inference
Casual Inference project for examination of movie-duration effect on its success

In the Following project, we investgate the effect of movie duration on its success by applying various Casual Inference models Including:
1. Inverse Propensity Score -LR/RF BASED
2. Stratification
3. Regression -Ridge with linear/non-linear (poly) features
4. Doubly Robust Estimator 
5. KNN (not implemented yet)

In addition, We perform a Sensivity Analysis to measure our confidence regarding each of the mentioned models
